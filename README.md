# arxiv-issue-bot

Automatically fetch new arXiv papers in your research areas and save their English abstracts into this repository.

## How it works

A GitHub Actions workflow runs daily, queries the arXiv API for recent papers in your configured categories, filters by optional keywords, and saves each new paper as a Markdown file under `data/papers/`. Duplicate papers are never archived twice.

## Quick start

1. **Fork** this repository
2. Edit `config.yml` to set your categories and keywords
3. Enable GitHub Actions in your fork (Actions tab > "I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them")
4. That's it -- the bot runs daily via GitHub Actions and commits new paper archives back to your repo

You can also trigger it manually: **Actions** tab > **Fetch arXiv Papers** > **Run workflow**.

## Configuration

Edit `config.yml`:

```yaml
# arXiv categories to monitor
# Full list: https://arxiv.org/category_taxonomy
categories:
  - cs.AI
  - cs.SE

# Optional keyword filters (applied to title + abstract)
# If empty or omitted, ALL papers in the categories above are posted.
keywords:
  - "large language model"
  - "transformer"
  - "refactoring"
  - "agent"
  - "bug"
  - "defect"

# Maximum number of papers to fetch per category per run
max_results_per_category: 50

# Optional: issue label prefix when create_github_issues is true
label_prefix: "arxiv"

# Whether to include cross-listed papers
include_cross_listed: true

# Where to save archived paper summaries
archive_dir: "data/papers"

# Optional: also create GitHub Issues for new papers
create_github_issues: false
```

Each archived file contains paper metadata plus the original English abstract.

## How deduplication works

- Each archive filename is based on the base arXiv ID, with the version suffix stripped
- Before saving, the bot checks whether that archive file already exists
- Optional GitHub issue creation still uses the same version-stripped ID check as before

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
python3 -m pip install .
python3 -m pip install pytest

# Run tests
python3 -m pytest

# Run locally
python3 -m src.main
```

## Extending

To add a new paper source (e.g., Semantic Scholar), implement the `PaperFetcher` interface in `src/fetcher.py`.
